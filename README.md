3D Game

"Every age has its storytelling form, and video gaming is a huge part of our culture. You can ignore or embrace video games and imbue them with the best artistic quality. People are enthralled with video games in the same way as other people love the cinema or theatre."
-Andy Serkis

My Goals:
Fun artistic game
Beautiful lighting
Unconventional controls
Focus on abstract shapes
Playful “feel”

Implemented
Features:
Collision detection and fire at will
Physical Collision Response
Disappearing Objects
Helicam
Game Physics
Plane Projected Shadows

Graduated accuracy--hit closer to center for greater impact


Game objectives
and
Interactions:

Shrink the Toruses
“Get” the enemies
Shoot them
Stomp them
“bubble” them
Grow the platforms

Unconventional Flight:
Create spheres to "bubble up"
When within threshold the spheres increase acceleration.y
Spent time toning the y acceleration for best feel.



This was a project for a computer graphics and image processing course. This took a few days and was a blast to make.
